Our contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.<\/p>\n<p>The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can communicate effectively, productively, and respectfully.<\/p>\n<p>The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.<\/p>\n<p>The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical in order for us to build a thriving community; for Hack Club to be successful, it needs hackers from all backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n\t\tWhere Does the Code of Conduct Apply\n\t<\/h2>\n\tIf you join in or contribute to our ecosystem in any way, you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.<br \/>\nExplicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to all official activities of our organization.\n<h2>\n\t\tOur Values\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<header>\nThese are the values to which people in the community should aspire.\n<\/header>\n<ul>\n<li>Be friendly and welcoming<\/li>\n<li>Be patient\n<ul>\n<li>Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Be thoughtful\n<ul>\n<li>Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Be respectful\n<ul>\n<li>In particular, respect differences of opinion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Be charitable\n<ul>\n<li>Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.<\/li>\n<li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Avoid destructive behavior:\n<ul>\n<li>Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.<\/li>\n<li>Unconstructive criticism: don&#8217;t merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer-or at least solicit-suggestions as to how things may be improved.<\/li>\n<li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)<\/li>\n<li>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.<\/li>\n<li>Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of\u00a0<em>all parties<\/em>\u00a0to de-escalate conflict when it arises.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n\t\tUnwelcome Behavior\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>These actions are explicitly forbidden in our spaces:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expressing or provoking:\n<ul>\n<li>insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;<\/li>\n<li>discrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability, gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar personal characteristic;<\/li>\n<li>bullying or systematic harassment;<\/li>\n<li>unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Advertisement or recruitment for events, companies, organizations, etc &#8211; unless specifically given permission by Hack ReFi<\/li>\n<li>Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>\n\t\tModeration and Enforcement\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>Please understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. When you participate, you should act in the spirit of our values. If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the Code of Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop, and your messages may be removed by community moderators. Repeated offenses may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the community.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>On your first offense, you will receive a written notice from one of our community moderators. Depending on the degree of the reported behavior, you may be asked to apologize, either in public or directly to the party that you have offended.<\/li>\n<li>On a second offense, you will be temporarily removed from the community. The period of the temporary ban may vary from 3 days to a month, decided based on the seriousness of the reported behavior. Please note that this ban\u00a0<strong>does not indicate that you are no longer welcomed in the community<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; it represents an official warning for your behavior.<\/li>\n<li>On a third offense, you may be asked to leave the community. Your account may be suspended for an indefinite amount of time, and you may be publicly identified.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This procedure only serves as a general guideline for moderation &amp; enforcement of our community conduct. Under all circumstances, Hack ReFi may take any action we deem appropriate, including immediate removal from the community.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our decision, please reach out to us directly at hackrefi@skiff.co<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\tReporting Issues\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>f you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to Hack ReFi using the process described below. <strong>Do not<\/strong>\u00a0post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mail hackrefi@skiff.com\n<ul>\n<li>Your message will reach us.<\/li>\n<li>Reports are confidential.<\/li>\n<li>Hack ReFi will strive to handle reports with discretion and sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties, and to avoid conflicts of interest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You should receive a response within 48 hours (likely sooner).<\/li>\n<li>The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine what happened.\n<ul>\n<li>With the permission of the person reporting the incident, Hack ReFi may reach out to other community members for more context.<\/li>\n<li>Hack ReFi will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing.<\/li>\n<li>A request for a private or public apology.<\/li>\n<li>A private or public warning.<\/li>\n<li>An imposed vacation (for instance, asking someone to abstain for a week from the project).<\/li>\n<li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all spaces.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Hack ReFi will reach out to the original reporter to let them know the decision.<\/li>\n<li>Appeals to the decision may be made directly to hackrefi@skiff.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note that the goal of the Code of Conduct is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible.<\/strong>\u00a0We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion and mutual agreement.
